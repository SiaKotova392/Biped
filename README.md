# Bipedal Robot Locomotion
The biped robot is assembled from the Dynamixel AX-12 motors, as well as other peripheral products (e.g., frames), manufactured and sold by [Robotis](https://www.robotis.us/), and controlled with the interface in Matlab, in addition to the SE2 code and a Biped class created from scratch. Using the Optragen/SNOPT optimization framework, a joint trajectory was designed to accomplish a single phase of a quasi-static walking gait. With one foot serving as the reference/stance frame, the trajectory was defined for the other foot frame to rise off the ground, swing forward, and step back down onto the ground. Simultaneously, the center of mass of the biped was restricted to remain within its support polygon. To demo, the biped was attached to the circular boom to restrict the robot to only planar motion and successfully executed the full walking gait throughout 15 gait cycles.
